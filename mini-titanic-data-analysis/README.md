# Mini Titanic Data Analysis 🚢🧊

This is a small analysis of a subset of the Titanic dataset (50 passengers).  
We explore passenger ages, survival rates, and survival percentages by passenger class using **NumPy**.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 50 passengers with the following columns:

1. **Passenger ID**: 1–50  
2. **Survived**: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
3. **Passenger Class**: 1 = Upper, 2 = Middle, 3 = Lower  
4. **Age**: 0–74  

## Analysis Goals

- Find the shape of the dataset  
- Calculate the average age of passengers  
- Identify the oldest and youngest passengers  
- Compute the overall survival percentage  
- Compute survival percentages by passenger class
