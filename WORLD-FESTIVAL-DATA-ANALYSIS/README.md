# World Festivals Dataset 🎋🎆🎊
(Pandas Beginner Data Analysis)

This project is a beginner-friendly data analysis task using a small, curated **World Festivals Dataset**.  
It demonstrates how to use **Pandas** for data exploration, querying, filtering, sorting, manipulation, and generating basic insights.  
This analysis is designed to build foundational data analysis skills through a realistic and clean dataset that is easy to understand.

## 📌 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains global cultural festivals with attributes such as: 🎡🎊

- **festival** – Name of the festival  
- **country** – Country where it is celebrated  
- **month** – Month of celebration  
- **theme** – Main cultural theme  
- **popularity_score** – Popularity rating (1–100)

This dataset is simple, clean, and perfect for practicing beginner-to-intermediate Pandas operations.

## 📊 Objectives of This Analysis

This project focuses on developing the following skills:

### **1. Basic Data Exploration**
- View head and tail of the dataset  
- Inspect shape, columns, dtypes  
- Summary statistics for numerical attributes  

### **2. Selection & Filtering**
- Selecting columns (Series & DataFrame forms)  
- Row filtering based on:
  - equality  
  - ranges  
  - `.isin()`  
  - `.str.contains()`  
  - multiple conditions (`&`, `|`, `~`)  

### **3. Sorting & Ordering**
- Sort by single column  
- Sort by multiple columns  
- Sort in ascending/descending order   

### **4. Highlighting Key Insights**
- Most popular festival (`idxmax()`)  
- Least popular festival  
- Top 3 and bottom 3 by popularity  

### **5. Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- Renaming columns  
- Creating new columns:
  - popularity categories  
  - text-based features (string lengths, uppercase)  
- Checking unique values
